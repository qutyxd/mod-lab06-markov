There are few things worth dying for.
There are few things worth living for.
Land is not enough for either. It's only dust.
And under that
The corpses buried for six thousand years.
And under that
The rock spewed forth
From a thousand suns.
And the sky is full of balls
Like this one.
You could have your pick of them.
There are enough of them
To go around
And then some.
Land is not enough.
There's always something more
Than that to drive the soldier to his duty.
Don't shoot until you know it.
If not, you'll miss the mark.
